### System Architecture

The CBS system comprises the following main components:

#### 1. Credit Management Engine (CME)

```
Component: Credit Management Engine
Purpose: Real-time credit calculation and enforcement
Features:
- 64-bit credit accumulator with signed arithmetic
- Programmable idle/send slopes (0-1000 Mbps)
- Configurable credit bounds (-65535 to +65535 bits)
- Sub-nanosecond timestamp resolution
- Parallel credit update for 8 queues
```

#### 2. Traffic Classifier and Queue Manager

```

2. Map to CBS queue (0-7)
3. Check credit availability
4. Enqueue or drop decision
5. Update queue statistics
```

#### 3. Machine Learning Optimizer

The ML optimizer uses the following algorithm:

```python
class CBSOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = NeuralNetwork(
            input_dim=12,  # Traffic features
            hidden_layers=[128, 64, 32],
            output_dim=4   # CBS parameters
        )
    
    def optimize(self, traffic_profile):
        features = self.extract_features(traffic_profile)
        parameters = self.model.predict(features)
        return {
            'idle_slope': parameters[0] * 1000,  # Mbps
            'send_slope': -parameters[1] * 1000,
            'hi_credit': parameters[2] * 10000,
            'lo_credit': -parameters[3] * 10000
        }
```

### Credit Evolution Algorithm

The fundamental credit evolution equation:

```
dC/dt = { idle_slope,  if queue_empty = 0 and C < hi_credit
        { send_slope,  if transmitting = 1 and C > lo_credit
        { 0,          otherwise

Transmission eligible when:
- C >= 0 (credit non-negative)
- Frame available in queue
- Output port available
```

### Implementation Details

#### Hardware Implementation

```verilog
module cbs_engine (
    input clk,
    input rst_n,
    input [63:0] idle_slope,
    input [63:0] send_slope,
    input [31:0] hi_credit,
    input [31:0] lo_credit,
    input frame_ready,
    output transmit_enable
);

reg signed [31:0] credit;
wire eligible = (credit >= 0) && frame_ready;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (!rst_n)
        credit <= 0;
    else if (!frame_ready)
        credit <= 0;  // Reset when queue empty
    else if (transmit_enable)
        credit <= credit + send_slope;  // Decrease credit
    else if (credit < hi_credit)
        credit <= credit + idle_slope;  // Increase credit
end

assign transmit_enable = eligible && port_available;
endmodule
```

    uint32_t port_id;
    uint32_t queue_id;

    int32_t hi_credit;   // bits
    int32_t lo_credit;   // bits (negative)
    bool enabled;
};

int configure_cbs(struct cbs_config *cfg) {
    // Validate parameters
    if (cfg->idle_slope < 0 || cfg->idle_slope > 1000000)
        return -EINVAL;
    
    // Write to hardware registers
    write_reg(CBS_IDLE_SLOPE(cfg->port_id, cfg->queue_id), 
              cfg->idle_slope);
    write_reg(CBS_SEND_SLOPE(cfg->port_id, cfg->queue_id), 
              cfg->send_slope);
    write_reg(CBS_HI_CREDIT(cfg->port_id, cfg->queue_id), 
              cfg->hi_credit);
    write_reg(CBS_LO_CREDIT(cfg->port_id, cfg->queue_id), 
              cfg->lo_credit);
    write_reg(CBS_ENABLE(cfg->port_id, cfg->queue_id), 
              cfg->enabled ? 1 : 0);
    
    return 0;
}

## APPENDIX A: Mathematical Proofs

### Theorem: CBS Latency Bound

For a CBS-enabled queue with parameters (idle_slope, send_slope, hi_credit, lo_credit), the maximum latency is bounded by:

```
L_max = (max_frame_size / link_speed) + (|lo_credit| / idle_slope)
```

**Proof:**
The worst-case latency occurs when:
1. Credit is at lo_credit (minimum)
2. A maximum-size frame arrives
3. No higher-priority traffic interferes

Time to recover credit: t_recovery = |lo_credit| / idle_slope
Transmission time: t_transmit = max_frame_size / link_speed
Therefore: L_max = t_recovery + t_transmit
