## Development Process

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/` - New features (e.g., `feature/add-tas-support`)
- `bugfix/` - Bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/credit-calculation`)
- `docs/` - Documentation (e.g., `docs/update-readme`)
- `test/` - Testing (e.g., `test/add-benchmark`)

### Commit Message Format

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Testing
- `build`: Build system changes

**Example:**
```
feat(calculator): add support for multiple traffic classes

- Implement multi-class CBS calculation
- Add validation for class priorities
- Update tests for new functionality

Closes #123
```

## Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

We use [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with the following tools:

- **Black** for code formatting
- **Flake8** for linting
- **MyPy** for type checking
- **isort** for import sorting

Run all checks:
```bash
make lint  # Or manually:
black src/ tests/
flake8 src/ tests/
mypy src/
isort src/ tests/
```

### Code Guidelines

```python
# Good example
def calculate_idle_slope(
    bandwidth_mbps: float,
    link_speed_bps: int = 1_000_000_000
) -> int:
    """
    Calculate CBS idle slope parameter.
    
    Args:
        bandwidth_mbps: Required bandwidth in Mbps
        link_speed_bps: Link speed in bits per second
        
    Returns:
        Idle slope value in bits per second
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If bandwidth exceeds link speed
    """
    if bandwidth_mbps * 1_000_000 > link_speed_bps:
        raise ValueError("Bandwidth exceeds link speed")
    
    return int(bandwidth_mbps * 1_000_000)
```

### Documentation Style

- Use Google-style docstrings
- Include type hints
- Provide examples in docstrings
- Keep line length under 88 characters

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_cbs_calculator.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Writing Tests

```python
# tests/test_example.py
import pytest
from src.cbs_calculator import CBSCalculator

class TestCBSCalculator:
    @pytest.fixture
    def calculator(self):
        return CBSCalculator(link_speed=1_000_000_000)
    
    def test_idle_slope_calculation(self, calculator):
        params = calculator.calculate_params(
            bandwidth_mbps=100,
            max_frame_size=1522
        )
        assert params['idle_slope'] == 100_000_000
        assert params['send_slope'] == -900_000_000
```

### Test Coverage Requirements
